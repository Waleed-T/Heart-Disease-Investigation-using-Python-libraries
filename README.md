# Heart disease investigation using Python libraries

The following project is based on heart disease investigation using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn Python.

The dataset has the following columns:

1.	age
2.	sex
3.	chest pain type (4 values)
4.	resting blood pressure
5.	serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.	fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7.	resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8.	maximum heart rate achieved
9.	exercise induced angina
10.	oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.	the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.	number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13.	thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
14.	target refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.


Based on the information in the dataset and after intial Exploratory Data aAnalysis (EDA), we have addressed the following areas and questions:

1.	Correlation using 'Correlation Matrix'.
2.	How many people have/don't have heart diseases?
3.	Find count of males and females in the dataset.
4.	Find gender distribution according to the target variable.
5.	Check age distribution in the dataset.
6.	Check chest pain type.
7.	Show the chest pain distribution as per target variable.
8.	Show fasting blood sugar distribution according to target variable.
9.	Checking resting blood pressure distribution.
10.	Compare resting blood pressure as per sex column.
11.	Show distribution of serum cholesterol.
12.	Plot continuous variables.
